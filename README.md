# Logica
 
This was an A-Level Project made in 2022-2023 and was my first time using Unity and figuring out the systems provided by the engine.
The concept was to make 3D logic gates in a cubic sandbox style similar to Minecraft

Doucmentation that was submitted alongside the project is also within the repository.
